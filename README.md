### Installation process

In order to install and run, firstly install the [MathReader](https://github.com/carolreis/mathreader) library.
Then download all files into a folder, run main.py and enjoy your latex code writing itself : ).

------------
### Manual and some tips

-> `Clear` - makes it all go away, you can start drawing from the beginning

-> `Resize` - (work in progress) you can choose from up to two different sizes of the window

-> `Render` - this is where the magic happens, send everything that you drawn into the A.I.'s mouth and receive a latex interpretation with an option to copy to your clipboard (you will still need to use "$$" or "$")

------------
1. try not to intersect written letters/mathematical symbols with eachother
